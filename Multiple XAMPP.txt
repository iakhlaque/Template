Steps to Set Up Multiple XAMPP Instances:
Download Different XAMPP Versions:

Download the different versions of XAMPP you need (e.g., one with PHP 7.x for your current project and another with PHP 8.x for other projects).
Install in Separate Folders:

Install each version of XAMPP in separate directories. For example:
C:\xampp7 (for XAMPP with PHP 7.x)
C:\xampp8 (for XAMPP with PHP 8.x)
Configure Different Ports (Optional but Recommended): If you want to run both XAMPP versions simultaneously, you'll need to change the default ports for Apache and MySQL in one of the XAMPP installations to avoid conflicts.

Change Apache Port:

Go to the XAMPP installation folder (C:\xampp7 or C:\xampp8).
Open apache\conf\httpd.conf and change:
Listen 80 to Listen 8080 (or any other available port).
ServerName localhost:80 to ServerName localhost:8080.
Save the changes.
Change MySQL Port (Optional):

Go to mysql\bin\my.ini in the XAMPP installation folder.
Change the port setting from 3306 to 3307 (or another available port).
Save the changes.
Start/Stop XAMPP Instances:

Use the XAMPP Control Panel for each instance (xampp-control.exe) to start and stop services. Ensure that only one version of Apache and MySQL is running at a time, unless you've configured different ports.
Running Both XAMPP Versions:
If you configured different ports for Apache and MySQL, you can run both XAMPP instances simultaneously.
Access each XAMPP instance via different ports:
For Apache on XAMPP7: http://localhost:8080 (or the port you set)
For Apache on XAMPP8: http://localhost:80 (or the default)
This setup allows you to use different PHP versions for different projects on the same machine.
