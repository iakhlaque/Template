How to fix Invalid request (Unsupported SSL request)

First make sure the APP_URL in the .env file is something like this: APP_URL=http://localhost or http://127.0.0.1:8000
Change APP_ENV=production to APP_ENV=development
Then run php artisan serve again
if above method doesn't work

Edit the /app/Providers/AppServiceProvider.php file: URL::forceScheme('https'); to URL::forceScheme('http');

and run the application again
